- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Olex

 I am a professional focused on the intersection between the energy sector and data analysis. I began my education with a degree in Physics from the University of Oviedo, later specializing in solar photovoltaic energy. Over the past four years, I have gained experience in managing residential and industrial photovoltaic self-consumption projects, automating processes and internal tools, as well as in business development, content creation for SaaS, and ETL processes.

Currently, my main focus is on the digitalization of the renewable energy sector (photovoltaics, HVAC, and electric vehicles), applying advanced data analysis tools. I am training in this field alongside the energy sector, using technologies such as Python, SQL, Power BI, MongoDB, and Excel, among other tools.
